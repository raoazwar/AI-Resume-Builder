PWA Icons Required

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add the following icon files to the public folder:

1. favicon-192x192.png - 192x192 pixel PNG icon
2. favicon-512x512.png - 512x512 pixel PNG icon

These icons should be:
- High quality PNG format
- Square aspect ratio
- Representative of your app (resume builder theme)
- Optimized for web use

You can create these icons using:
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Convert existing logos to the required sizes

Once you add these files, the PWA manifest will work correctly and users can install your app on their devices.

Note: The current manifest.json references these files, so the PWA features won't work properly until they're added.
